NixOS & Home Manager configuration
==================================

This is my current configuration for my home machine. It's made using the [nixos-unified module](https://github.com/srid/nixos-unified)

## To-Dos
- [x] Fix clipboard handling
- [ ] Fix Mac Keyboard bindings
- [ ] Rofi themes
- [ ] Rofi power menu

## Ideas
- Look at https://aylur.github.io/ags/ eg in https://github.com/Aylur/dotfiles/tree/ags-pre-ts

## Cider-2
Cider 2 is purchased and needs dedicated installation
    nix-store --add-fixed sha256 cider-linux-x64.AppImage
